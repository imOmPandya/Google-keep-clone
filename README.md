## Description

Google Keep Clone is a single-page application that replicates the functionality of Google Keep, a popular note-taking app. It allows you to create, edit, archive, unarchive, delete, and recover notes. Each note can have a title and a description. You can easily rearrange your notes by dragging and dropping them for efficient organization.

## Features

- **Create and Edit Notes:** Create new notes and edit existing ones with titles and descriptions.
- **Archive and Unarchive:** Archive notes to keep them out of your main view, and unarchive them when needed.
